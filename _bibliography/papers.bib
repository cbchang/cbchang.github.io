  author={Tseng, Amelia and Chang, Charles B. and Leal, Tania and Lee, Jin Sook and López, Belem},
  year={2025},
  abstract={Research in Heritage Speaker Bilingualism unites diverse methodological perspectives on heritage language research, offering insights into key research questions, experimental designs, research techniques, and instruments used to investigate heritage languages. This ambitious volume covers a variety of linguistic, affective, social, and educational perspectives, all related to heritage language research. Each chapter provides a state-of-the-art overview of the topic under discussion with examples from a variety of heritage languages, is written in a highly accessible way featuring activities, and leads to further research literature. Readers are guided through theoretical background, research justification, creation, use, and the possible outcomes of key research methods.},

  title={Coarticulation and coordination in phonological development: Insights from children’s and adults’ production of complex–simplex stop contrasts in Gã},
  author={Kpogo*, Felix and Chang, Charles B.},
  annotation={* student author},
  abstract={Achieving adult-like coarticulation, which relies on precise gestural coordination, is known to be a challenging aspect of phonological development. Unique coordination challenges are posed by doubly articulated stops, typologically uncommon complex consonants that show crosslinguistic variation in their acoustic contrast with simplex (singly articulated) consonants. We examined the acoustics and development of complex-simplex stop contrasts between labio-velars (/k͡p/, /g͡b/) and bilabials (/p/, /b/) in Gã (Niger-Congo, Kwa), with special attention to coarticulation with adjacent sonorants. We found that Gã adults mostly produced differences in voice onset time and closure duration to implement these contrasts, and Gã five-year-olds also produced differences in these dimensions. Crucially, however, five-year-olds also produced significant differences in onset formants, which adults did not. These findings provide evidence of age-graded variation in the implementation of complex-simplex stop contrasts in Gã, suggesting that over the course of development there may be a shift away from production of carryover coarticulatory differences toward greater reliance on durational differences. We argue that children's initial reliance on carryover coarticulation capitalizes on a tendency toward greater consonant-vowel coarticulation as compared to adults, discussing implications for our understanding of how coarticulation develops.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
