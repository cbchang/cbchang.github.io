Welcome! I'm a member of the <a href="https://lt.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Department of Linguistics and Translation</a> and the Director of the <a href="https://thepamlab.github.io/" target="_blank">Phonetics, Acquisition &amp; Multilingualism Lab</a> (PAMLab) at <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">City University of Hong Kong</a>. I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.sparksociety.org/" target="_blank">SPARK Society</a> and the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/ncid/people/ncid-diversity-scholars-network.html" target="_blank">Diversity Scholars Network</a>. Currently, I serve as an Associate Editor of the journal <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/slr" target="_blank"><em>Second Language Research</em></a> and as the Treasurer of the <a href="https://labphon.org/" target="_blank">Association for Laboratory Phonology</a>. My pronouns are the 'he' series (he/him/his).

If you are a student interested in working with me at CityU, please read <a href="https://thepamlab.github.io/for-students/prospective-phd" target="_blank">this page</a> if you are a prospective PhD student, or <a href="https://thepamlab.github.io/for-students/prospective-mphil" target="_blank">this page</a> if you are a prospective MPhil student.

My research generally concerns the relationship between linguistic experience and phonological knowledge over the lifespan. Much of my recent research addresses two central questions in the study of the <strong>acquisition</strong> and <strong>attrition</strong> of sound systems:
<ol>
 	<li><em>How is acquisition of a new language sound system influenced by the learner's experience with a previously-learned sound system, such as that of their native language (L1)?</em></li>
 	<li><em>How does phonological acquisition of a new language affect the learner's knowledge and use of their previously-learned language(s)?</em></li>
</ol>
I approach these questions primarily by examining the processing, representation, and development of speech sounds in the context of second language (L2) and additional language (Ln) learning, multilingualism, and language contact. This empirical focus leads to work that is strongly <strong>cross-linguistic</strong> in nature, that uses a variety of <strong>experimental techniques</strong> and <strong>quantitative methods</strong>, and that examines both the individual learner (including <strong>individual differences</strong>) and the speech community.
